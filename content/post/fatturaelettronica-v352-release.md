I just released [FatturaElettronica .NET v3.5.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FatturaElettronica/3.5.2). It gets around a [known CVE](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hh2w-p6rv-4g7w) so you may want to update ASAP. The Fattura Elettronica open-source project allows for the validation and de/serialization of electronic invoices that adhere to the standard defined by the Italian Revenue Agency.
