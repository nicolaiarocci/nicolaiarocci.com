> If you want to understand time — which is how you come to befriend life — turn to stone.
> Climb a mountain and listen to the conversation between eons encoded in each stripe of rock.
> Walk a beach and comb your fingers through the golden dust that was once a mountain.
> Pick up a perfect oval pebble and feel its mute assurance that time can grind down even the heaviest boulder, and smooth even the sharpest edge.
