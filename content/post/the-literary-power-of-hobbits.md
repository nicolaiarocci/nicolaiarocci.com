[Verlyn Flieger][1] on the late addition of Tolkien's most iconic characters:

> Hobbits were no part of Tolkien’s original plan. They entered rather late and through a side door, as the unexpected central characters in a children’s story, The Hobbit which Tolkien invented for his own children but which found an immediate and lasting worldwide audience. And of which The Lord of the Rings was the commissioned, longed-awaited and trebly successful sequel.

_[The Literary Power of Hobbits: How JRR Tolkien Shaped Modern Fantasy][2]_ is a good short read (*[via][3]*)
