Today's Armin Ronacher's [AI Changes Everything](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/4/changes/) strongly resonates with me[^1]. I may not be using Claude Code as a daily driver as he now does, but I've slowly and steadily introduced large language models (LLMs) into my routine, and I'm reaping the benefits.

It wasn't the purpose of his article, but I wish Armin had gone into the details of how, why, and when he delegates tasks to Claude Code.

_Update:_ Armin later a [follow-up](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/10/genai-criticism/).
