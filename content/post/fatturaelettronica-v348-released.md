Fattura Elettronica for .NET v3.4.8 was [released][1] on NuGet today. The [Fattura Elettronica][2] project allows for the
validation and de/serialization of electronic invoices following the Italian Revenue Agency standards. As with the
previous one, this release also addresses a small undocumented behavior in validating the invoice. See the [relevant
ticket][3] for the details.
