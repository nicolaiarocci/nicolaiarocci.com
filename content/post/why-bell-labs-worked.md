[Why Bell Labs Worked](https://1517.substack.com/p/why-bell-labs-worked) is a fascinating, evocative read. 

> We live in a metrics obsessed culture that is obsessed with narrowly defined productivity. There's too much focus on accountability and too little focus on creativity. The reason why we don't have Bell Labs is because we're unwilling to do what it takes to create Bell Labs â€” giving smart people radical freedom and autonomy. The freedom to waste time. The freedom to waste resources. And the autonomy to decide how.
