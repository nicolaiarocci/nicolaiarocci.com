title: The ROI of exercise

Like Herman below, I exercise daily. A one-hour brisk walk in the early morning on weekdays before sitting at the desk, and four weekly sessions of bodyweight strength training (known as calisthenics nowadays). If it's going to be a scorching hot day, I'll immediately follow the walk with the training, take a shower, have breakfast, and then start work. In the cooler season, I'll stop working at noon and exercise before lunch instead. During the weekend, I often take long [walks](https://nicolaiarocci.com/tags/walks/), go [hiking](https://nicolaiarocci.com/tags/hiking/), and rest. 

I'm turning 55 in a few days, and sometimes I wonder if I should slow down or reduce the intensity of my training. I've made adjustments along those lines in recent years, but I suspect I am still pretty active for my age.

Today I read [Herman's post on the ROI of exercise](https://herman.bearblog.dev/exercise/), and it is spot on. It's common sense; we've all read those things, but here they are nicely compiled. The concept that lifelong exercise "adds extra years to each stage of life rather than just frail years at the end" hit home for me.
