title: Code from my session at WPC 2025

On Wednesday, I held a session  titled "Feature Flags and Dynamic Configurations in C#" at [WPC 2025](https://www.wpc.education/). It went well, at least judging by the offline questions that came in at the end of the session and which almost made us late for lunch. 

Attending WPC is always exciting. The audience is large, the rooms are big and well-equipped, the energy is just right, and there's always a chance to catch up with friends and colleagues. I especially enjoy seeing fellow Microsoft MVPs and speakers.

As promised, here is a [link to the repository](https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/featureflags) with the code I demonstrated; just read the README to get your bearings. Oh, and as expected, someone in the audience got nerd-sniped by that `cj` bash function [I mentioned](/curl-and-jq-go-to-a-conference/).
