Quoting [Andreas](http://82mhz.net/posts/2025/06/blogs-are-still-a-thing/):

> Blogging is a small niche these days. There isn't much hype around it, nor is there any money to be made because the VC firms are all busy chasing the next big thing, whatever that might be once the AI hype dies off in a year or two. But it is still here, and I like it exactly because it's not the hype technology of the day anymore. It isn't commercialised, algorithmically curated and set up to make some other person rich.
