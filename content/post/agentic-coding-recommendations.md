Armin Ronacher is on a roll. He just published his [Agentic Coding Reccomendations](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/12/agentic-coding/). 

On the topic of Agenting Coding he recently published:

- [AI Changes Everything](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/4/changes/) (you should read it)
- [GenAI Criticism and Moral Quandaries](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/10/genai-criticism/)

Both already [reported](http://localhost:1313/ai-changes-everything/).
