I'm always fascinated by these in-depth bibliography efforts, and this one, with
its unique 300-page catalog detailing 7,400 titles from Charles Darwin's
library, is nothing short of extraordinary. 

> John van Wyhe, the academic who has led the “overwhelming” endeavour, said it showed the extraordinary extent of Darwin’s research into the work of others.

> “It also shows how insanely eclectic Darwin was,” Van Wyhe said. “There is this vast sea of things which might be an American or German news clipping about a duck or invasive grasshoppers. That’s been the fun part, not the formal books but the other things … all of which pool together to make the theories and publications we all know.”

The Guardian article is [here](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/11/charles-darwin-entire-personal-library-revealed-first-time). I had to dig a little to surface the [actual catalog](http://darwin-online.org.uk/Complete_Library_of_Charles_Darwin.html) on the Darwin Online website.  Many titles even have links to their text contents and images.
