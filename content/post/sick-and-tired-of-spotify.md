title: Sick and tired of Spotify's music-consuming model

I'm growing sick and tired of Spotify's music-consuming model. There are many
compelling and sometimes conflicting reasons, most perfectly outlined in *[The
day I canceled my Spotify
subscription](https://blog.raed.dev/posts/goodbye_spotify)* on Raed's blog.

> I used to cherish music, I used to religiously collect, catalog and enjoy
every album on my iPod. I could navigate the endless folders and find that exact
song that I needed for that precise moment. Spotify killed that, I listen to
what it suggests and just accept that it will go away when it decides to rotate
it out. Spotify trained me not to look too hard, to let the flow be, and if that
awesome song is gone or removed, don’t worry, we still have a million more.

And also:

> The main screen is littered with podcasts I don’t care about, nor have I ever
listened to. It keeps pushing playlists that feel generic, bland, more based on
demographics than my years of consistent listening history. And there is nothing
I can do about it.

I can't cancel my subscription yet, as I would risk being lynched (we're on the
family plan), so I'm experimenting with digital purchases of selected music that
I know I want to keep for the long run and that I deem worth sustaining
directly. The current plan is to buy it on Bandcamp, immediately download it,
and then listen to it, probably on Doppler. I will also drop a quick review on
my website (if it is not exciting enough to share here, it's probably not worth
buying in the first place.) I've been gathering old-style music sources lately
(I primarily follow music critics and websites I respect and listen to live
stations like [NTS](/nts-radio/), Radio Paradise, and Bandcamp Radio). For the
time being, Spotify will stay and serve as a secondary discovery agent. 

Yes, I will spend more on music, and it's okay. I won't buy everything I listen
to anyway; the idea is to only invest in the true gems. In a way, this all looks
like going back to old and brick-and-mortar music shop days but actualized, and
I like it a lot.
