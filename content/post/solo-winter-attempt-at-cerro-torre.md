My mountaineering days are mostly left behind, and I miss them, so now and then,
I look at some YouTube videos from the field specialists. Today, the algorithm
suggested I watch a truly phenomenal one by [Colin Haley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Haley).

What makes it so unique is the raw, unedited "I'm filming for my family" feeling
that there is to it.  He's sweating, swearing, worrying and freezing like, you
know, the rest of us. Colin seems a lovable, down-to-earth guy, I like his
attitude. Oh, and I would've bailed much sooner than him.
