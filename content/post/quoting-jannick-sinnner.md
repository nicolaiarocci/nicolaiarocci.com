I just watched an [incredible interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KreEMoS0drQ) with legendary tennis coach Darren Cahill, now coaching Jannick Sinner. The interview is outstanding and worth watching; Cahill is remarkable and a great communicator. In the final part, they're talking about Jannick when Cahill [drops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KreEMoS0drQ&t=3498s) an incredible Jannick quote:

> Don't worry about criticism from someone you wouldn't take advice from.

That's profound for a boy who's just 23 years of age.
