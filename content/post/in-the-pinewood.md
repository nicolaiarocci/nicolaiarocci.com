I went for a walk in the [local pinewood](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xYHc8GpX7fRN5ZqT6) the other day. It's one of my favorite places, especially the least frequented parts, where one can walk for hours (and risk getting lost) without meeting anyone. I cut it shorter this time as it started to drip rain, and I had nothing with me.
