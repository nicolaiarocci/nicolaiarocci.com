After years of care, the orchid in the bathroom has bloomed again. I moved it from the edge of the bathtub, where it had been surviving in a wilted state for years, to the sink, hoping to water it more often, which I did. Nothing else: no repotting, no fertilizer, the same light as before. The resilience of nature.
