On Thursday, I will be conducting an MCP Server session at the [Summer AI Afternoon](https://www.eventbrite.it/e/summer-ai-afternoon-tickets-1428458029419) event organized by [DevMarche](https://dev.marche.it) in collaboration with [DevRomagna](https://devromagna.org), the neighbouring development communities. There are more than 50 people signed up already, and I'm so looking forward to meeting old and new friends down South.
