Quoting straight from [Jim Nielsen's note](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-06-13T0927) on LLM training on copyrighted data:

> As a broke teenager, the web was this strange wonderland where you could access all kinds of copyrighted material using tools developed by fringe individuals/communities: Napster, Kazaa, Torrents, Usenet, etc. These tools (at least in the beginning) weren’t really made for profit, just to subvert the gatekeepers (and yeah, steal their profits).
> 
> Now — in a strange twist of irony — things seem to have flipped:
> - 1999: Individuals use digital tools to steal intellectual property from corporations.
> - 2025: Corporations use digital tools to steal intellectual property from individuals.
> 
> The empire strikes back.
