After two years of avoiding it, I finally got Covid. First two days, I had
a few symptoms but was testing negative (it was likely to be Covid because one
of my daughters was positive.) On day three, I tested positive. It's ten days
now, but only during the first three or four I didn't feel good: a light fever,
pinching throat, some coughing and sleepiness, that's all.  I did not have to
miss any working days (I'm self-employed) and only had to skip two of my daily
training routines[^1]. I'm in my early fifties, healthy, fully vaccinated and
boosted. 

These days, in our household, three out of four got the Covid. Our eldest son
is in Berlin at the university, but he got Covid one year ago when studying in
France. As I write, I learn that my brother and his wife have tested positive.
Hopefully, our elders will stay clear of it. I'm so thankful for all the
science that makes this less terrible.
