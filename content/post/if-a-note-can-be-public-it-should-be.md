Quoting [Dries Buytaert](https://dri.es/if-a-note-can-be-public-it-should-be):

> A few years ago, I quietly adopted a small principle that has changed how I think about publishing on my website. [...] The principle is: If a note can be public, it should be.

Unconsciously, I am trying to do the same, as you might have noticed by the increased activity on this website. Maintaining consistency can be challenging, but it's worth the effort.
