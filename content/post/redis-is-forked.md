Vicki Boykis has a [good piece](https://vickiboykis.com/2024/04/16/redis-is-forked/) on Redis's recent vicissitudes. At the same time, she recaps where we stand and sings the praises of a project that many are fond of, and not just for its technical worth.

> I, like many developers who have worked on high-scale, low-latency web services over the last fifteen years, have an intimate relationship with Redis. At any new job, when you ask where the data is, and someone points you to a server address with port 6379, you know you will meet an good, reliable friend there.

Redis is indeed an awe-inspiring project. I have met Salvatore (antirez), its author, several times. He's a down-to-earth and brilliant guy. I admit I feel nostalgic for Redis' "heroic" period when Salvatore was at the helm and Redis was for developers, not enterprises.
