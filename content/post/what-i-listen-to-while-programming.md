What music do you listen to while programming?[^6] For me, it's usually jazz,
classical, electronic, lots of it, or nothing. There are some specialized
websites and podcasts I sometimes recur to, like [Music for Programming][1].
Several Spotify playlists I dig a lot, [Every Day I'm Nerdin'][2] being one of
them. What can I say? I am musically omnivore. 

However, I recently discovered something different: the [Field Recordings
podcast][3]. "A podcast where audio-makers stand silently in fields (or things
that could be broadly interpreted as fields)." I am told it was launched last
year, just about when the COVID lockdowns started, by acclaimed UK audio artist
and producer Eleanor McDowall. It's free, updated daily with submissions coming
from all over the world, and holds many treasures. Most episodes are short, I'd
say around the 5 minutes mark, with some notable exceptions like [The Sound of
2020][4], "A slow weave of some of 2020's Field Recordings in chronological
order". One of my favorites has got to be the "[Inside the log burner][5]"
episode by Chris Attaway (Devoran, Cornwall, UK, January 2021):

> "I was prepping a fire in our log burner on a cold, blustery day here in
> Devoran, Cornwall and the wind whistling through the vents was really creepy!
> So I stuck my Zoom inside and recorded it for a bit. It was like it had its
> own little atmosphere and weather inside!"

At my desk churning out code, I hit play, and that stove is instantly
teleported here, right by my side. I can almost feel its warmth. Indeed,
there's something cathartic about listening to these sound fragments from all
over the world.
