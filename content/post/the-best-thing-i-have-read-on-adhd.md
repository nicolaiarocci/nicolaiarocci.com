title: The best thing I have read on ADHD
tags: ["adhd"]
---
I read [ADHDâ€”A Lifelong Struggle](https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html) today.
It's the best thing I've read on ADHD so far. Its advice is grounded in
experience and applies to everyone: those who think ADHD is a crock or, worse,
an excuse, those who suffer from it, and those who have family members or
friends who suffer from it. 

> And we all punish ourselves. That's the real tragedy of this illness. We are
our biggest detractors because we know what we're capable of. Better than our
teachers. Better than our parents. They always said that they could "see our
potential," but we saw ten times what they did. Every day. We saw the things we
could do, in our heads, and hated ourselves for not doing them.

There are so many good lines in the article that I highlighted twelve whole
paragraphs with many more deserving, and I struggled to pick one to quote here.
