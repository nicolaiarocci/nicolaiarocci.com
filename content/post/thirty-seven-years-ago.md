Thirty-seven years ago, at about 11 a.m., at the Rocca Brancaleone Park, my then-girlfriend and I kissed for the first time under a tree. We decided immediately not to get together because we were classmates[^1], and we didn't want to complicate our lives. 

Right. 

We have been together ever since and will celebrate our 27th wedding anniversary next week. Our three sons are the fruitful result of that teenage affair.

[^1]: We skipped class on that day.
