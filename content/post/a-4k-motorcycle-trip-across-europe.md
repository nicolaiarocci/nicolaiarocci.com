title: A motorcycle trip across Europe

Last night, I returned from [Trifest 75](https://www.tomcc.org/Trifest/tomcc75),
a motorcycle rally organized by the [Triumph Owners Motorcycle
Club](https://tomcc.org)[^1] at the Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb, Worcester, UK.
Crossing Europe from South to North took us a whole week across Italy,
Switzerland, and France before reaching the soil of England. 

This outing was conceived long ago (Trifest happen every year) and has always
been postponed because of the high cost and time required. This year, we took
the opportunity of the 75th anniversary to go, partly because I sensed the great
interest while talking about the idea at various rallies we had last year in Italy. 

We were twenty motorcycles strong. Leading such a large group across Europe for
4,000 km is no joke, but somehow, we made it through without significant issues.
Energy and mood were always high, and we were welcomed with open arms by our
English friends and by the other Triumph Owners Clubs attending: Germany,
Sweden, and Holland. It was an excellent opportunity to strengthen the bond
between us Italians and make new international friendships, laying the
foundation, who knows, for future occasions.
