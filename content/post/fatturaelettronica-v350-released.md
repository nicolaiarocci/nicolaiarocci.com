I just released [FatturaElettronica .NET v3.5.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FatturaElettronica). This version adds multi-language support, all thanks to the excellent work done by [Michael Mairegger](https://michaelmairegger.it). We currently support Italian and German and are ready to accept contributions for other languages. The Fattura Elettronica open-source project allows for the validation and de/serialization of electronic invoices that adhere to the standard defined by the Italian Revenue Agency.
