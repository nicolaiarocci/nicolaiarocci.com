After five years in Oracle's MySQL team, Steinar H. Gunderson resigned a few
days ago. On the same day, he dropped the bomb on his [blog][1]:

As [@brandur][3] appropriately puts it, in the world of software engineering,
it rarely gets more definitive than that. And authoritative, I might add, given
both the role he covered at Oracle and his overall [track record][5]. The whole
