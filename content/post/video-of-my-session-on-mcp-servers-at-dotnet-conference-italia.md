I presented a session at the [.NET Conference Italia 2025](https://www.aspitalia.com/eventi/97/.NET-Conference-Italia-2025-Milano.aspx) in Milan a couple of weeks ago. The title was "Integrating our applications with LLMs and AI via MCP Servers". It was well received; there were good questions throughout the talk and in the hall afterward. Surprisingly, live coding and demos went relatively smoothly.

The fine guys at ASP Italia just published the [video](https://media.aspitalia.com/events/netconf25-LLM-dotNET-AI-MCP.media) in case someone is interested. 

Yeah, it is in Italian. I got a transcript from MacWhisper and then asked Claude to translate and clean it up. It did a pretty good job, so let me know if there's any interest in an English transcript; I might post it here.

Speaking of English, I've started submitting to international events again, without any luck so far. The conference landscape has changed quite a bit, especially since the COVID break. I still get invited to local ones, while internationals have been elusive. I suspect my change in technology stack plays a role. It was relatively easy to speak abroad when I was into Python. With .NET, not so much. But again, I was into Python in the pre-COVID era, so it is hard to tell which factors are at play and what their weight is.
