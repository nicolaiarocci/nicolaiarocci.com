I recently bought [Dirty
Rat](https://orbitalofficial.bandcamp.com/track/dirty-rat-2), the absolute
banger from Orbital's 2023 Optical Delusion. It couldn't be anything different,
given that it's a collaboration between the seminal electronic duo that emerged
from the rave era and one of my British favorites, Sleaford Mods.

Sleaford Mods' barbed lyrics perfectly augment Orbital's concrete-heavy
digitalism. Mods' James Williamson lambasts the people, "blaming everyone in the
hospital, everyone at the bottom of the English Channel, and everyone who
doesn't look like a fried animal." 

> I guess it's about telling people to take responsibility for their own
actions, you know, all these politicians don't come from out of nowhere.
Somebody keeps voting them in. So who might that be? --Paul Hartnoll, Orbital
