tags: ["programming", "dotnet", "links"]

> "For decades, garbage collection in .NET was a background concern. It was mostly invisible to the everyday developer and was regarded as 'automatic' unless (or until) something slowed down the application. However, .NET 10 changes this perspective by making garbage collection (GC) a key component of application performance."

[What .NET 10 GC Changes Mean for Developers](https://roxeem.com/2025/09/30/what-net-10-gc-changes-mean-for-developers/) is a good in-depth article that explores the revolutionary garbage collection improvements in .NET 10, which deliver 2- 3x performance gains through seven key enhancements: escape analysis for stack allocation, DATAS enabled by default, flexible region sizing, delegate optimizations, intelligent write barrier elimination, enhanced devirtualization, and refined heap controls for containers.
