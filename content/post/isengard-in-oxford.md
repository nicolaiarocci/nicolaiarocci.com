The Los Angeles Review of Books on [_The Bovadium Fragments_](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/isengard-in-oxford/), JRR Tolkien’s posthumous complete work, which was just recently published.

> Anyone who has read Tolkien’s letters will know that he is at his funniest when filled with rage, and The Bovadium Fragments is a work brimming with Tolkien’s fury—specifically, ire over mankind’s obsession with motor vehicles. Tolkien’s anger is expressed through a playful satire told from the perspective of a group of future archaeologists who are studying the titular fragments, which tell of a civilization that asphyxiated itself on its own exhaust fumes. Tolkien’s fictional fragments use the language of ancient myth, reframing modern issues like traffic congestion and parking with a grandeur that highlights their total absurdity. It is Tolkien at his angriest and funniest, making The Bovadium Fragments a minor treasure in his ever-growing catalog.

Tolkien’s repulsion toward machines is well documented, with Isengard serving as the in-story metaphor for technology used wrongly. The canonical reference has always been the war machines used in World Wars I and II, which he witnessed with terror on the battlefield. I never imagined that he also glimpsed Isengard in his everyday life, and much closer to home: in the polluted streets of Oxford.
