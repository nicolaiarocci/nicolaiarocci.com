I couldn't recall a [tmux][5] command, so I quickly reached for my trusted default
search engine DuckDuckGo. I typed "tmux cheat sheet" because, well, once
I found an excellent one which I wanted to summon again. To my surprise, the
[search result][1] included an in-page cheat sheetâ€”a good one too.

It isn't the first time that DuckDuckGo surprises me like that. Need a new
GUID? [Search for it][2].

Need a quick QR code? [Of course][3].

DuckDuckGo should be everyone's default browser for many [valid reasons][4], and
in-page results for frequent searches (or [Istant Answers][6] as they call them)
sure isn't the most prominent one, but it is handy to have around. It is also of
some comfort to see that I'm obviously not the only one forgetting tmux
commands.
