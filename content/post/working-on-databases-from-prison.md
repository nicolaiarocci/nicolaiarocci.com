[Preston Thorpe](https://turso.tech/blog/working-on-databases-from-prison):

> I'm very excited to announce that I have recently joined Turso as a software engineer. For many in the field, including myself, getting to work on databases and solve unique challenges with such a talented team would be a dream job, but it is that much more special to me because of my unusual and unlikely circumstances. As difficult as it might be to believe, I am currently incarcerated and I landed this job from my cell in state prison. If you donâ€™t know me, let me tell you more about how I got here.

What a remarkable story of redemption and an example of how far hard work, determination, and discipline can take you.
