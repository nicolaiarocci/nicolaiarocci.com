### The man who mistook his wife for a hat and other clinical tales, Oliver Sacks

★★★☆☆

(_L'uomo che scambio sua moglie per un cappello, Adelphi_)

Quoting a comment on Goodreads, to which I have nothing to add: "This book has many fascinating studies of neurological disorders, and the stories behind the patients are easily understood and, in many cases, enthralling. However, Dr. Sacks seems to give his readers too much credit when he throws off "hyperagnosia", "Korsokovian", and "meningioma" like he assumes we had read an entire neurology textbook before picking this one up."

### Source code, by Bill Gates

★★★★☆

Autobiography of Bill Gates from early childhood to the early steps of Microsoft. An interesting work for many reasons, not the least of which is that I find myself in many of the traits and passions of young Gates, on an almost disturbing level. One of the main characters recounts a key moment: the advent of micro and personal computers, and how they changed everything.

### Papyrus, by Irene Vallejo

★★★★☆

Papyrus by Irene Vallejo (originally titled "El infinito en un junco" in Spanish) is a fascinating work about the history of books in antiquity. I think Vallejo did an excellent job telling the history of writing and books in an accessible yet scholarly way. Her ability to weave historical facts with interesting anecdotes makes the text engaging. As I understand, the autobiographical digressions that sometimes can annoy the reader are characteristic of her style - she uses her personal experience as a bridge to connect modern readers with the ancient world. The book is particularly strong when describing how texts survived through centuries thanks to dedicated copyists, libraries like Alexandria, and the transition from papyrus scrolls to codices (the ancestors of modern books).

### Libera Università, by Tomaso Montanari

★★★★☆

Tomaso Montanari is a lucid and sharp thinker; this text proves it. By the author's admission, this is a militant, non-technical work. No solutions are offered to the many problems of Italian universities; that is not the goal (albeit one of his own texts on the subject would be interesting). The importance of a clear separation between the tertiary education system and executive power is emphasized more than ever in a season such as the current one, dominated by parties that hark back to totalitarian ideologies. I found the chapter about Italian telematic universities and how they're encouraged and leveraged by at least parts of the executive power fascinating.

### Cambiare la storia, by Adriano Prosperi

★★★★☆

Is human history editable? One way people have tried to change the historical course of humanity is by fabricating fakes. There is no shortage of examples; in this book, Adriano Prosperi focuses on a few in particular—the Donation of Constantine, perhaps the most famous among historical fakes. The second case concerns the historical inventions of the visionary Annio da Viterbo, who rewrote world history, starting with the Flood and prophesying the place and date of the apocalypse. One finds its model in the false chronicles and fake archaeological finds of seventeenth-century Granada, where moriscos threatened with expulsion from Spain invented the existence of a very ancient presence of Christian Arabs who came to Spain before St. James. But the most disturbing of the examples is the fourth, that of the "Protocols of the Elder Saviors of Zion," notoriously false yet still widespread and operating. Changing or negating history does not pertain to the modern day; it has always been part of the process.

### Grandma Gatewood's Walk, by Ben Montgomery

★★★☆☆

(*La signora degli Appalachi, Terre di mezzo*)

"Grandma Gatewood's Walk" by Ben Montgomery tells the remarkable true story of Emma Gatewood, who, at age 67, became the first woman to hike the entire Appalachian Trail solo in 1955. After enduring decades of domestic abuse and raising 11 children, Emma left home with minimal supplies—wearing Keds sneakers and carrying only a tiny denim bag with necessities. She told her family she was "going for a walk" without revealing her ambitious 2,050-mile journey from Georgia to Maine. The book weaves Emma's extraordinary hike together with her complicated personal history, highlighting her physical resilience and mental determination. Montgomery reveals how her journey captured America's imagination, bringing significant publicity to the then-obscure Appalachian Trail. Emma's accomplishments established her as a pioneering figure in hiking and inspired generations of hikers, particularly women. The book portrays her as a hiking legend and a symbol of perseverance who found freedom and purpose in nature after a life of hardship.

Emma Gatewood was genuinely revolutionary in what we now recognize as ultralight hiking philosophy decades before it became a formal movement. While experienced hikers of her era typically carried 30+ pounds of gear, Emma completed the entire Appalachian Trail with a homemade denim bag containing minimal essentials—a change of clothes, a shower curtain for shelter, some food, and little else. Her choice to wear simple Keds sneakers instead of heavy hiking boots was remarkably ahead of her time. What makes her achievement even more extraordinary is the context—she had no GPS, no specialized lightweight equipment, no online trail forums, and minimal trail markings compared to today. The Appalachian Trail was rougher and less developed in 1955, with fewer shelters and support infrastructure. Her approach embodied the core ultralight philosophy: bring only what you need, rely on your knowledge and adaptability rather than gear, and understand that mental fortitude often matters more than equipment. Emma proved that age, gender, and expensive gear were not prerequisites for tackling ambitious wilderness challenges.

### The death of Ivan Ilyc, by Lev Tolstoy

★★★★☆

(*La morte di Ivan Ilyc, Feltrinelli*)

This work is a potent warning against the superficiality of life and a call to seek a more authentic and conscious existence. The main themes (and there are many for a booklet of a few pages, but that is what can be achieved by a giant of literature) are the inevitability of death, the hypocrisy of "civilized" society, alienation and loneliness, the meaning of life, and redemption through suffering. It is one of Tolstoy's minor works, the philosophical-religious period from his second and last periods. Admirable.

### La scomparsa di Majorana, by Leonardo Sascia

★★★☆☆

Since March 26, 1938, traces have been lost, between his departure and arrival on a sea voyage from Palermo to Naples, of the 31-year-old Sicilian physicist Ettore Majorana, whom Fermi would not hesitate to call a genius of the stature of Galileo and Newton. Suicide, as the investigators of the time want to believe and let belief, or voluntary escape from the world and the terrible fates that such a mind may have read into the future and the near future of science? In this admittedly speculative work, Sascia favours the latter. Sciascia's arguments are intriguing but not entirely convincing to me. The value of this work lies in Majorana's biography, which is well-documented and told. One is left wondering what Majorana could have achieved in his career if he hadn't fled from it.

### The Moon and the Bonfires, by Cesare Pavese

★★★★☆

*(La Luna e i Falò, Edimedia)*

The Moon and the Bonfires by Cesare Pavese is a novel published in 1950 and is considered his masterpiece. The book explores several key themes, including:

- Return and Memory: The protagonist, Anguilla, returns to his hometown in the Langhe after years of absence. The contrast between past and present becomes a central element of the narrative.
- Identity and Sense of Belonging: As an orphan who sought fortune in America, Anguilla questions his roots and whether he truly belongs anywhere.
- War and Its Consequences: In the aftermath of World War II, the novel highlights the scars left by the conflict, mainly focusing on the Italian Resistance and its impact on people and the land.
- Myth and Disillusionment: The moon and the bonfires symbolically represent the contrast between dreams and reality, between the desire for something more significant and the harsh truth of rural life.
- The Human Condition and the Inescapability of Fate – Pavese explores themes of solitude and the search for meaning, often portraying life with a melancholic and fatalistic outlook.

The novel is intensely autobiographical and reflects Pavese’s existential concerns, offering a universal meditation on memory, identity, and the pain of existence.

### Mornings in Jenin, by Susan Abulhawa

★★★☆☆

*(Ogni mattina a Jenin, Feltrinelli)*

I received this novel as a Christmas present from my kids, and I'm grateful to them for this powerful, passionate, eye-opening novel. Set against one of the twentieth century's most intractable political conflicts, Mornings in Jenin is a deeply human novel of history, identity, friendship, love, terrorism, surrender, courage, and hope. Its power forces us to take a fresh look at one of the defining conflicts of our lifetimes.

### The heartbeat of the wild, by David Quammen

★★★☆☆

*(Il cuore selvaggio della natura, Adelphi)*
