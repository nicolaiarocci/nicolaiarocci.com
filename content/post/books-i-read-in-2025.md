The usual scoring system applies:

* One star means a book is meh.
* Two stars mean a book is perfectly fine.
* Three stars mean a book is good—consider it recommended.
* Four stars mean a book is exceptional.
* Five stars is pretty much unheard of.

### Mornings in Jenin, by Susan Abulhawa

*(Ogni mattina a Jenin, Feltrinelli)*

I received this novel as a Christmas present from my kids, and I'm grateful to them for this powerful, passionate, eye-opening novel. Set against one of the twentieth century's most intractable political conflicts, Mornings in Jenin is a deeply human novel of history, identity, friendship, love, terrorism, surrender, courage, and hope. Its power forces us to take a fresh look at one of the defining conflicts of our lifetimes.

> For if life had taught her anything, it was that healing and peace can begin only with acknowledgment of wrongs committed.

★★★☆☆

*(Il cuore selvaggio della natura, Adelphi)*

An annotated collection of memorable field reports written for National Geographic over nearly three decades by David Quemmen.  

> Human beings are the problem on this planet, but they are also the solution.
