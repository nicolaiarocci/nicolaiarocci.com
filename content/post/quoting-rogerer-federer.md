> When you’re playing a point, it is the most important thing in the world. But
when it’s behind you, it’s behind you... This mindset is really crucial, because
it frees you to fully commit to the next point… and the next one after that…
with intensity, clarity and focus.  

> The truth is, whatever game you play in life... sometimes you’re going to
lose. A point, a match, a season, a job...  it’s a roller coaster, with many ups
and downs.  And it’s natural, when you’re down, to doubt yourself. To feel sorry
for yourself. And by the way, your opponents have self-doubt, too. Don’t ever
forget that.  But negative energy is wasted energy.  

> You want to become a master at overcoming hard moments. That to me is the sign
of a champion.
