title: Europe needs an independent tech infrastructure

Sam over at [theTangentSpace](https://thetangent.space/2026/infrastructure/) has the perfect analysis on Europe's sorry situation in these troubled times, so much so that I have a hard time picking just one or two paragraphs to quote here. Let’s just go with the opening:

> Europe must increasingly prepare for a world in which the protection _of_ America is replaced by protection _from_ America. An essential component of this is moving away from dependence on US goods and services and, perhaps most essential of all, US tech and tech infrastructure.

And then, towards the conclusion:

> A potential silver lining of Europe disentangling itself from US tech is the opportunity to embed social values and democratic oversight into the design of these systems. US tech firms are massive, centralised surveillance platforms that routinely abuse their users and reproduce existing social inequalities. We could do better via better regulation of the private sector, and more public sector options.

Let's do it, Europe.
