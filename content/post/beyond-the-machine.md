I'm just back from reading the transcript of [Beyond the Machine](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2025/beyond-the-machine/), a thoughtful and insightful talk by Frank Chimero.

> I’m trying to figure out how to use generative AI as a designer without feeling like shit. I am fascinated with what it can do, impressed and repulsed by what it makes, and distrustful of its owners. I am deeply ambivalent about it all. The believers demand devotion, the critics demand abstinence, and to see AI as just another technology is to be a heretic twice over.
> Today, I’d like to try to open things up a bit. 

I'm surprised by how brilliantly Rick Rubin, Brian Eno, Hayao Miyazaki, and Miyazaki's _Spirited Away_ are packed into this talk.
