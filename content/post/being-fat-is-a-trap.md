Federico Pereiro's [Being Fat is a Trap](https://federicopereiro.com/fat-trap/) is, I think, a great piece of advice. Way more people than I wish who are close to me are struggling with eating disorders of all kinds, so I'm sensible about the topic. 

This sentence, in particular, rings true in an aching way:

> Judging people inside the fat trap just intensifies their misery and reduces the odds they can get out of it.
