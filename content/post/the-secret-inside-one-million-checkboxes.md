> A few days into making One Million Checkboxes I thought Iâ€™d been hacked. What was that doing in my database? A few hours later I was tearing up, proud of some brilliant teens.

What a great story. Teenagers who are enthusiastic about hacking and coding and have lots of fun in creative ways. It reminds me so much of my teenage years, like when assembling a fake backdoor on Lorien, my first BBS, as a honeypot to attract local hackers so I could later reach out and get to know them[^1]. 

Long gone are those days, and I wish I still had that kind of drive.
