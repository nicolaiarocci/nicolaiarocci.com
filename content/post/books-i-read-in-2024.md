### The question of Palestine, by E.W. Said

*(La Questione Palestinese, il Saggiatore)*

★★★☆☆

I was interested in learning about Israeli-Palestinian history from the beginning, and I wanted it told from the perspective of an Arab-Palestinian scholar and critic. In the West, we grow with Western and pro-Israeli narratives, and it is super-hard to get access to the Palestinian narration. The Palestinian Question turned out to be the ideal text. "The tragedy of being a victim of victims."

### The garden of the Finzi-Contini, by Giorgio Bassani

*(Il giardino dei Finzi-Contini, audiolibro)*

★★★★☆

The Garden of the Finzi-Contini is probably the most understated and effective novel about the Holocaust. It is also a bittersweet and nostalgic tale of youth. The reconstruction of provincial life in the years immediately preceding World War II is touching, especially if one is fortunate enough to know Ferrara and its historic town center. The prose is rich, the characters are all indispensable and well-chiseled, each peculiar in his way, but some stand out, like Micol. The dialogues, never trite, often hint at unspoken yet implied meanings. Near the novel's end, the late-night conversation between the protagonist (whose name we never know) and his old father touched me deeply. This slow burner picks up pace as it approaches its inevitable, bitter end.

### Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius

*(Pensieri, Oscar Mondadori)*

★★★★☆

Marcus Aurelius, one of the Five Good Emperors of Rome, kept a journal to collect his thoughts about how to live well. It was not meant for the public, and in fact, it did not go public until centuries after the emperor's death, when it surfaced in its original Greek form, probably with missing and corrupted parts. Meditations is that journal, a work of motivational advice that inspires us in stoicism and a manual for being a complete, mature adult living a dignified, thoughtful life. Some concepts repeatedly resurface throughout the twelve books that make the text:

- inevitability of death
- irrelevance of the individual no matter their importance in life
- how to be a good man
- forgive the defects of others
- accept and embrace what comes at us, be it good or bad
- live in accordance wit nature

These and others were reflections and aims meant for the author, not lectures for an audience. That these thoughts came from the most powerful man in the world makes it all the more impressive. Two thousand years have passed, and humanity still struggles with the same essential topics and unanswered questions.
