### The Question of Palestine, by E.W. Said

*(La Questione Palestinese, il Saggiatore)*

★★★★☆

I was interested in learning about Israeli-Palestinian history from the beginning, and I wanted it told from the perspective of an Arab-Palestinian scholar and critic. In the West, we grow with Western and pro-Israeli narratives, and it is super-hard to get access to the Palestinian narration. The Palestinian Question turned out to be the ideal text. "The tragedy of being a victim of victims."
