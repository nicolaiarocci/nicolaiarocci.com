title: Ethan Mollick's first impressions on Gemini Advanced

Ethan Mollick, one of my few [LLM/AI
sources](/some-hints-about-what-the-next-year-of-ai-looks-like/), just dropped
his first impressions on Gemini Advanced, released today, but which he's been
testing for a month in early access.

> Let me start with the headline: Gemini Advanced is clearly a GPT-4 class
model. The statistics show this, but so does a month of our informal testing.
And this is a big deal because OpenAI’s GPT-4 (the paid version of
ChatGPT/Microsoft Copilot) has been the dominant AI for well over a year, and no
other model has come particularly close. Prior to Gemini, we only had one
advanced AI model to look at, and it is hard drawing conclusions with a dataset
of one. Now there are two, and we can learn a few things.

Things are getting hotter in the LLM space, and competition is always good.
