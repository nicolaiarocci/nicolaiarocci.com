Yesterday the creator of the Python language, Guido van Rossum, [tweeted][1]
about [The Origins of Python][2], an essay by his mentor, Lambert Meertens. 


> "On Sunday, June 21, 1970, in an office building on Great Portland Street in
> London, a teletype sprang to life. Under the heading "HAPPY FAMILIES," the
> machine rattled out a sequence of English sentences, such as "THE DOG SITS ON
> THE BABY" and "UNCLE TED PLAYS WITH SISTER." The "Happy Families" program
> that produced this output had been written that same weekend by someone with
> no prior programming experience, a participant in a workshop organized by the
> Computer Arts Society offering a course in "non-numerical programming."

> Almost fifty years later, on October 26, 2019, in Istanbul, the eyes of a
> young woman lit up as she managed to get her very first program to run. She
> was attending a workshop organized by Django Girls, an international
> non-profit organization aiming to empower women through free, one-day
> programming workshops. 

>The programming language used at the London workshop in 1970 was TELCOMP, a
>simple unstructured language similar to BASICâ€”not BASIC as it is now, but
>unstructured BASIC as it was then. The programming language taught at the
>Istanbul workshop in 2019 was Python, a programming language designed by Guido
>van Rossum that has become wildly popular, steadily gaining in popularity
>since an inconspicuous public release in 1991. As far apart as these events
>are, both in time and geography, an arc of history connects them."

It is a magnificent article. If you're passionate about Python, and programming
languages in general, make sure to read it.[^3]
