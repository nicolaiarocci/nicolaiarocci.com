Thanks to Giovanni Ansaldo's convincing review on yesterday's issue of
[Il Mondo](https://www.internazionale.it/ilmondo) podcast, my first Bandcamp
purchase[^1] is the recently released [Astral
Gold](https://deanmcphee.bandcamp.com/album/astral-gold) album by Dean McPhee, a
British guitarist who combines folk with experimental music and jazz using his
telecaster guitar to create endless landscapes. 

As the title suggests, McPhee's latest album is a journey into outer space. The
album consists of six instrumental pieces, all captivating, enjoyable, and
cohesive; they all serve as each other's natural continuation. Along with the
sound of his guitar, the musician uses tape loops, small percussion sounds, and
a few synthesizers here and there. The result is a hypnotic moonscape
reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey[^2]. 

The album avoids easy psychedelia and opts for a more meditative approach while
meeting expectations perfectly. Sometimes, it sounds like Brian Eno's early
ambient phase and the more dilated Tangerine Dream. Dean McPhee has created an
otherworldly experience with just a few elements; minimalism is key.

recent Spotify tirade and how I decided to return to purchased music.

[^2]: On a lateral note, this music would fit perfectly as an EVE Online
soundtrack. I vividly remember my space pirate days in that game, exploring far
away and unknown solar systems, looking for prey while listening to JÃ³n Hallur Haraldsson's
incredibly immersive [original
soundtrack](https://archive.org/details/eve-online-soundtrack) (McPhee is on
another level, and the two genres don't compare, but hey.)
