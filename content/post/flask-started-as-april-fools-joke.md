The story that the Python micro web framework Flask started as an April Fool's
joke is well known in Python circles, but it was nice to [see it told by Armin
Ronacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXJwX3tpMe0) himself[^1].

I'm fond of Flask. It was a breath of fresh air when it came out, and most of my
Python [open-source](/opensource/#python) work is based on it.

[^1]: The video is produced by the people who also authored the remarkable [Python: The Documentary](/python-the-documentary/).
