Today, I learned about [Marp](https://marp.app), the "Markdown Presentation Ecosystem," which comes with an enticing promise: _to create beautiful slide decks using an intuitive Markdown experience._

For my [latest presentation](/mcp-or-connecting-our-apps-to-llms/), I utilized the Slides Extended Obsidian plugin, which is based on reveal.jsâ€”an excellent option for keeping slide decks within one's Obsidian vault  (I keep all notes, work and personal journals, and knowledge in Obsidian.)

Marp could be a viable alternative to the plugin, as Obsidian notes are just markdown files. The advantage here is that I can further elaborate or iterate on my slides, for example, from the command line, as Marp comes with a dedicated [CLI tool](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/) that lets you export to PDF, HTML, and more. Additionally, Marp is not based on reveal.js, a tool that has given me headaches in the past.

My understanding is that Marp is more geared toward producing "static" slides intended for PDF or other outputs (HTML included, though). In contrast, reveal-based solutions allow for more advanced features, such as animated slides, which I don't like and use anyway.
