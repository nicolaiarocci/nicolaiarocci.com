I've been reading Marcus Aurielius' *Meditations* and, very appropriately and
scaringly, YouTube algorithm thought I would be interested in [Marcus Aurelius,
the Man Who Solved The Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv6W0Nv5ev0).
The title is bombastic and misplaced, but the video is well executed and
correctly summarizes some of the Emperor-Philosopher's thoughts.
