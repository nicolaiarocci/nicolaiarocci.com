> Upon his death in 1543 in Frombork, Poland, Copernicus was buried in the local
cathedral. Over the subsequent centuries, the location of his grave was lost to
history. There were several unsuccessful attempts to locate Copernicusâ€™s
remains, dating as far back as the 16th and 17th centuries. Another failed
attempt was made by the French emperor Napoleon after the 1807 Battle of Eylau.
Napoleon held Copernicus in high regard as a polymath, mathematician and
astronomer. In 2005, a group of Polish archaeologists took up the search.
