Last night, I was at an outdoor theatre with Serena, watching Anatomy of a Fall (an excellent film). Outdoor theatres are becoming rare, which is a pity, and [Arena del Sole](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j7t3SigtkPtKnB22A) is lovely with its strong vintage, 80s vibe. There's little as pleasant as watching a film under the stars with your loved one on a quiet summer evening.

Anyway, in the pause, I glanced at my e-mails and discovered I had been again granted the [Microsoft MVP Award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/mvp/profile/a6892d61-aea0-e511-8114-c4346bac0abc). It is the ninth consecutive year, and I'm grateful and happy the journey continues. At this point, I should put in some extra effort to reach the 10-year milestone next year.
