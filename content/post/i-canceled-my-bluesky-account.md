title: I canceled my Bluesky account

I deleted my Bluesky account. I didn't follow anyone anyway, and I only used it to repost content from my website. Being almost mainstream now, I found Bluesky to have the same dynamics as other mass-adopted social networks: controversies, lots of ego-hunting, vanity fairs, sterile debates, witticisms, and everything else that doesn't interest me. 

Having left Twitter [a while ago](http://localhost:1313/im-leaving-twitter/x/) and Facebook a long time before that, I'm left with [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@nicola) precisely because there are fewer people there, and they are more in my niche; it feels like the pre-mass social media world, like the first Twitter years. Not coincidentally, I'm also receiving more feedback on my content than anywhere else.

I doubt I'll get back into social networks; they failed me hard. I get all my news from RSS anyway, where I can select the sources, and there's no algorithm dictating the agenda.
