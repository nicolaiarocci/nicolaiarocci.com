I never knew about the connection between Ray Bradbury, John Huston, and Herman Melville. 

> Today, few people are aware that Bradbury, renowned science fiction writer, beloved fantasist, and mainstay on banned-book lists, wrote the screenplay for the 1956 John Huston adaptation of the Melville classic, which starred Gregory Peck as the iconic and obsessive Captain Ahab. Writing the screenplay was a dream come true for Bradbury, until it morphed into a waking nightmare. As the old adage goes: Never meet your heroes.

Fascinating stuff. Well written, too. Read the full story [here](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/i-am-herman-melville/).
