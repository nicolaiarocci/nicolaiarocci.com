title: Listening to purchased music is the way
tags: ["music", "spotify"]

Happy Easter, everyone. This morning, I completed the long-overdue move of all
my ripped CDs from my old 2012 MacBook Pro to the new one and, then, to my
iPhone. I'm using Doppler on both devices. I like Doppler, a simple yet elegant
MP3 player app with few well-thought-out features.

I am increasingly convinced that [returning to purchased music is the
way](https://nicolaiarocci.com/sick-and-tired-of-spotifys-music-consuming-model/).
I've been listening to streaming services for so long that I almost forgot the
accomplishment of listening to music I own. This music was so significant when I
first listened to it that it was worth buying and carrying along over the years.
It's tangible, too: it's sitting right next to me, on my hard disk and my phone;
I can look at it and, yes, touch and move it as I please, as I can with my
original CDs. The same goes for the new music I buy on Bandcamp or elsewhere.

I can download music from Spotify, but that's rented music that I cannot move
away from the app. 

It's also relevant that a much more significant part of my money goes to the
artists when I purchase their music, and I'm glad for that because I'm thankful.
I want their business to be healthy and prosperous so that I may enjoy more of
their art in the future.

I'm listening to *Dance Cadaverous* from Wayne Shorter's *Speak No Evil*, a song
I probably last listened to ten years ago. *Speak No Evil* is one of the 100 CDs
that, back in the day, I started collecting from [The Best Jazz (pre-1980) Ever
Released Digitally](http://jazz100.sffjazz.com/top100.html). I never completed
that collection. I may resume it now, although future purchases will likely be
just MP3s.
