title: Paying people to work on open source is good actually
tags: ["links", "open-source"]

From my experience as a maintainer of midly successful open-source projects, I
have come to the conclusion that people who criticize accepting payment for work
on such projects are either acting in bad faith or are incredibly naive. 

Anyway, Jacob Kaplan-Moss's recent *Paying people to work on open source is
good* is a stellar post on the topic of open-source sustainability.

> My fundamental position is that paying people to work on open source is good, full stop, no exceptions. We need to stop criticizing maintainers getting paid, and start celebrating. Yes, all of the mechanisms are flawed in some way, but that’s because the world is flawed, and it’s not the fault of the people taking money. Yelling at maintainers who’ve found a way to make a living is wrong.
