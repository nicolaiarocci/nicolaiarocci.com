I am speaking about OAuth2 and Open ID Connect with ASP.NET Core 8 at [Rome .NET
Conference 2024](https://www.dotnetconf.it) on March 22 and then, less than a
week later, at [WebDay 2024](https://www.webdayconf.it) in Milan. 

I am always particularly excited when I can present the stuff I'm currently
working on. Being forced to share as I learn encourages me to go deeper into the
topic to reinforce my comprehension and better explain it to the audienceâ€”a
win-win situation.

While the Rome conference is free, if you are considering [WebDay in
Milan](https://www.webdayconf.it) (you should), feel free to use my speaker
coupon P-SPEAKER10 for a 20% discount.  If you come to any, don't be shy and
come to say Hi!
