The video and slides of my C# 12 session at .NET Conference Italia 2023 is
finally [available
online](https://www.ugidotnet.org/e/sessione/3295/C-12-Cosa-c-e-di-nuovo-e-interessante).
Unfortunately it's just my voice and my laptop screen, and that's too bad
because the location was as cool as it can get, and the room was packed. 

It is in Italian[^1] and you need to login in order to see it (sorry, I
don't have control over it.)

[^1]: I also submitted to several international conferences; let's see what
happens. Since the COVID hiatus, I've had no luck with international events.
