Why does [man](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html) print "gimme gimme gimme" at 00:30? 

> The maintainer of man is a good friend of mine, and one day six years ago I
jokingly said to him that if you invoke man after midnight it should print
"gimme gimme gimme", because of the Abba song called "Gimme gimme gimme a man
after midnight".  Well, he did actually put it in. A few people were amused to
discover it, and we mostly forgot about it until today.
