I took a daily hike in my beloved Apennine Mountains a few weeks ago. One of my favourite motorcycling routes is the narrow, engaging, panoramic road that unites Corniolo in the Bidente Valley with Marradi and the Mugello area via the Braccina Pass. I always wanted to return and hike through it; the moment had come.

It was an excellent circular tour that, to the merits of moderation-it is not too long, nor too strenuous, the ascent is always gradual, etc. - also combines the variety of the environment, shading from mixed mid-altitude broadleaf forests (hornbeams, oaks, ash, cherry, maple) to coniferous reforestations that in this case, with increasing age and size, have taken on a certain dignity. 

[Valpisella](https://forlicesena.anpi.it/valpisella/) is a rural stone building dating back to 1872 and later reclaimed as a vacation home by the volunteer work of ANPI partisans. When I arrived, I could hear people enjoying their lunch inside. It's a nice place; unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture.

If hiked at a brisk pace, it might take only half a day, but with a few well-deserved stops and savouring the myriad details that the various seasons can offer, it fills the whole day without difficulty.


The Corniolo/Braccina route marked my first winter hike of the season. I recently realized that, to me, daily hikes are more accessible in the winter. In summer, I'm usually too busy between motorcycling trips with the [Club](https://tomccitalia.org/), family matters, holidays and, since we live close by, going to the beach.
