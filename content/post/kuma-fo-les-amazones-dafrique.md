title: Kuma Fo by Les Amazones D'Afrique

> Inspired by the historic Dahomey Amazons and founded by three of the biggest powerhouses in African music, Mamani Keïta, Mariam Doumbia, and Oumou Sangare, Les Amazones d'Afrique have been using their voices to advocate for women's rights since their 2017 debut. The group has never shied away from mashing up tradition and technology. Still, on Musow Dance, with the endlessly inventive production of Jacknife Lee, they lean heavily into an almost entirely electronic sound, turning up the energy several notches with booming 808s, dramatic synth slides, and bursts of vintage disco. But none of these additions ever overshadow the true soul of the music, instead amplifying the already formidable voices of Les Amazones d'Afrique's ever-evolving lineup ([source](https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-of-2024/the-best-albums-of-2024-g-m)).

[Musow Dance](https://lesamazonesdafrique.bandcamp.com/album/musow-danse) is a stunning release, and Kuma Fo is just the perfect leading track. Every component is on point, finely dispensed and precisely interleaved: voices, sound, beat, you name it. The producer, after all, is Jacknife Lee (R.E.M., Taylor Swift, U2.)

Then, there are the lyrics with their meaninful message. While they all sing in their native language (the four members are from different African countries), I could dig out the English translation from the [official video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHeC03169e4), which is equally good and powerful.

She preserves life, gives the first breath  
She preserves life, gives the first breath  
Woman oh, oh woman  
She gives the first breath  

Chorus:  
Whatever they say  
Whatever women have to say  
Is worth listening to  
Life is hard, I fight with courage, let me be  
Whatever they say  
Whatever women have to say  
Is worth listening to  
You know, my life is mine, so give me space  

The world was created by a woman  
Mika mika mika mika mika  
She preserves life  
Mika mika mika mika mika  

You wonder how we’re gona make it?  
We decided to gather our strength and fight  
Whatever it costs  
You wonder how we’ll make it?  

Chorus  

You light up life  
You light up life  
To educate a woman is to educate a village  
To educate a girl is to educate the world  
Get up, get up, get up   
Regain your feminine strength  
Woman, woman, woman, get up, get up   
Regain your feminine strength  

I travelled to the North  
People from the North told me  
That women have dignity   
I travelled to the West  
People from the West told me  
That women have dignity  

I belong to myself, I’m free to do what I like  
I will not accept what others want me to be  
I belong to myself, I’m free to do what I like  
I will never accept it anymore  

Chorus  

Whatever they say  
Whatever women have to say  
Is worth listening to  
I will not be driven like a car  
Woman, woman, woman  

You give hope  
You give hope  
You give hope  
You give life  
To educate a woman is to educate a village  
To educate a girl is to educate the world
