Quoting [Bryan Baun](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/07/31/capability-makes-your-life-simpler/):

> Capability makes your life simpler. Tolerance, skills, knowledge, and health are always with you, wherever you go. They are assets but they take up no space. They are stored in your body. Some lack capability through no fault of their own, but anyone can increase their capability. Itâ€™s an investment that pays dividends every day.
