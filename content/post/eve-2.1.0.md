Today I released Eve v2.1, which comes with official Flask 2.2+ support and the ability to modify the pagination limit
on a per-resource basis thanks to the new `pagination_limit` setting. You can find the release on [PyPI][1],
while the changelog is available [here][2]â€”special thanks to [Pieter De Clercq][3] and [smeng9][4] for the help with this release.
