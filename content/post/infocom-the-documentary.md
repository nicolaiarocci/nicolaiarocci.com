For nerds of my generation, Infocom is a legend. Today, I watched the long-time overdue *Infocom: The Documentary* and I found it to be a gem.

With no commentary or narration but made up of the protagonistsâ€™ testimonies alone, it effectively evokes the excitement and enthusiasm around the early computer game industry (and software development in general) of those early years. It is also a cautionary tale about how easy it is to fall once you reach the peak[^1]
