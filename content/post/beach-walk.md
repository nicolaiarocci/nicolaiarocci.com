Our third kid turned eighteen yesterday; she's an adult now, and we're left with no teenagers in our family. She is on a celebrative short trip to Barcelona so we are alone at home, for the first time. It's only temporary, but it'll become the norm in just over a year when she leaves for University. What a strange feeling; the nest is going to be empty soon. It will take a while before we get used to it.
