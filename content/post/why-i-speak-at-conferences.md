title: Why I speak at conferences
tags: ["speaking", "obsidian"]

Among the essential reasons I continue to make presentations at various conferences is that the preparation required to deliver good content forces me to learn and comprehend a topic in greater depth. I always try to talk about the stuff I am working on: the commitment to explaining what I am learning in public forces me into a higher level of knowledge.

In the past few weeks, I have spoken about OAuth2 at [two different conferences](https://nicolaiarocci.com/i-am-presenting-on-oauth2-at-two-conferences-this-month/), and OAuth2 has been precisely the subject of my work for the past few months, and it still is now. It goes like this: I study and implement things, and while doing that, I say to myself, hey, this could be an exciting topic for other devs, too. I let the idea cool down for a few days, and then, if it still seems good, I start looking for a fitting call for papers. Magic happens if the proposal is accepted: I am forced to turn from a superficial connoisseur to someone close to a field expert. That's the level of competence to aim for if one wants to talk publicly, especially on a technical topic. 

Something new happened yesterday. As I was writing the OAuth2 documentation for the next iteration of our APIs, I realized I could reuse some of the material from my live sessions. In the talk, it made sense to dedicate a few minutes to explain the [OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1), so I used [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas) to draw two diagrams, one with a high-level view of the flow while the other would zoom into the details. I could now take the first one, streamline and simplify it, and then include it in our official documentation. And that's what I did.

That presentation took a while to prepare, but the delivery was good. It took me to a new level of expertise, and part of that work landed in our product. It was all well worth the effort.
