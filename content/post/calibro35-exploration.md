Calibro 35's Exploration, their latest album that I have just purchased, supremely fits and redefines the instrumental jazz-funk genre, adding a firm pinch of "vintage futurism," as they call it. 

> We were born with our heads facing forward and our eyes looking backward toward the future and the past. We have always struggled more with the present.

A review that makes them justice and includes a concise yet well-done listening guide is on [Far Out](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/calibro-35-exploration-album-review/).

I'm excited to see them live in [September](https://dice.fm/event/yokb7a-calibro-35-3rd-sep-rocca-malatestiana-cesena-tickets).
