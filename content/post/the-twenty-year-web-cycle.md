title: The 20-year indie web cycle, maybe

The History of the Web has an interesting take on the resurgence of blogging and
the indie web that seems to be occurring these days. 

> With roots in the world of fashion, there exists a cyclical principle
suggesting that every two decades, previously popular trends “every 20 years or
so the trends that were once popular will begin to be on the forefront again.”
What’s old is new again. However, these recurring trends aren’t just rip-offs.
They are remixed and reinterpreted through the lens of a new generation. We are,
perhaps, in a 20 year resurgence for the indie web and blogging.
