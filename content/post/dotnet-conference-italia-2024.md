I'm speaking at the [.NET Conference Italia 2024](https://www.dotnetconference.it) on Dec 16th in Milan at the Microsoft House. My session is titled [C# 13 What's New and Interesting](https://www.dotnetconference.it/e/sessione/3589/C-13-e-NET-9-cosa-câ€™e-di-nuovo-e-interessante) and will be on the latest iteration of the C# language. We'll also briefly touch on .NET 9, which was also just released. Hope to see you there (make sure to come to me to say Hi!)
