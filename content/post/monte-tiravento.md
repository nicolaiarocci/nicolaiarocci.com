Yesterday, I went on a hiking trip to Monte Tiravento. This majestic loop tour
is uncommon compared to the classic woody image of the Parco Nazionale del
Foreste Casentinesi, as it takes place mainly on aerial and partly even barren
ridges, resulting in magnificent views. Compared to other variants I did in the
past, this one starts at a high altitude, offering lower elevation differences.

It is inadvisable on the hottest summer days when the nearby forests offer more
cover from the scorching sun, but it is a real treat throughout the rest of the
year.

Reasons for environmental interest, other than in individual uncommon botanical
species (at least red juniper and turkey oak), lie mainly in the wild valleys
overlooked by what is the "turnaround" as well as the highest point of the
itinerary, Monte Tiravento (and even the name testifies to the splendid
isolation of the site) and in the beautiful ruin of the medieval Montalto Tower.
A final appendage to see monumental oaks further embellishes the hike. I met
several groups on the trail, and we're in February, so I'd expect these ridges
to be crowded in spring and autumn.
