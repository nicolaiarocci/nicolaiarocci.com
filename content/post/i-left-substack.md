title: I'm leaving Substack
tags: ["substack", "newsletter"]

If you are one of the few following me on Substack, I have news: I'm
leaving Substack and moving to a [different
platform](https://buttondown.email/refer/nicolaiarocci). I actually left a
couple of weeks ago; my latest posts are not on Substack and you can find them
on [my website](https://nicolaiarocci.com) (the source of all my content), or
you can subscribe to the [new
newsletter](https://buttondown.email/nicolaiarocci) or the [RSS
feed](https://nicolaiarocci.com/index.xml) like hackers do.

If you're an old-time Substack subscriber, you already know because I
transferred all the active subscriptions to the new platform. I'm writing for
the occasional passerby looking for fresh content.

Why I left Substack? Two reasons: 

1. It's [full of
garbage](https://badnewsletter.substack.com/p/all-the-garbage-i-found-on-substack),
has a [nazi
problem](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/11/substack-extremism-nazi-white-supremacy-newsletters/676156/),
and it is monetizing on all this stuff. I don't want to be associated in any
possible way with an enterprise like this, and I certainly don't want to offer
them visibility, no matter how little.

2. Substack does not support RSS-alimented campaigns, so I had to copy & paste
every single post from my website manually. That is tiring and error-prone.

Because of 2, Substack was not my platform from the get-go. I knew, but I
was willing, as an experiment, to put in some extra work in exchange for the
visibility. 

I'm not willing to compromise on 1.
