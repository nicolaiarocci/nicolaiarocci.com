From roughly the late 80s until the mid-90s, every month I would visit the newsstand at my city's train station, hoping to snag the single copy of BYTE Magazine that arrived in town (at least one other hunter was competing with me: I often won, but not always, which frustrated me tremendously). I understood little to nothing with my rudimentary school English, but I was too stubborn to give up. I credit BYTE Magazine as one of my significant English teachers. Flipping those pages was exciting, and, as unbelievable as it may seem today, back then the advertisements were just as captivating as the articles themselves. Granted, I was also reading Italian computing magazines, but most were copycats of the one authoritative source [^1].

Thank you, whoever you are, for the extraordinary work done on [this website](https://byte.tsundoku.io/) ([via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45028002)).
