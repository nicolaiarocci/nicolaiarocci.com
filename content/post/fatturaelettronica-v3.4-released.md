Today I released v3.4 of [FatturaElettronica][1], a .NET open source project
that allows validation and de/serialization of electronic invoices adhering to
the standard defined by the Italian "Agenzia delle Entrate". It's doing very
well for such a niche project, with downloads now well beyond the one hundred
thousand mark. 

Be aware that this release anticipates support for [v1.7.1][2] of the
specification going into effect on October 1, 2022. For more information, see
the appropriate [ticket][3] and the [changelog][4].
