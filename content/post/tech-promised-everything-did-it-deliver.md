I have had the good fortune of meeting Scott several times at various conferences and the MVP Summits held at Microsoft headquarters in Seattle. Seeing him get emotional in this talk does not surprise me, nor is it unusual for him to criticize the very technology[^1] that his company promotes. 

He has always been an entertaining speaker and teacher. As it turns out, the TED format suits him perfectly.
