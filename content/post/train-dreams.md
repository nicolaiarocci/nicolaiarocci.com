With all the medium-to-very-low-quality productions we've been accustomed to from Netflix, it was a pleasant surprise and a relief to watch [Train Dreams](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29768334/) last night. 

I'll quote the most recent review on IMDb:

> Robert's life is gently lived and not without profound tragedy. The film evokes our own memories, little joys and sadnesses, discoveries, losses, and hopes, bringing grace to our self-reflection. The film is heartbreakingly beautiful. Acting, editing, and direction are just right. 

I read on Wikipedia that it's doing very well, and deservedly so. Of course, I now regret not having known about or read the [novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_Dreams) before watching the movie. 

_Update:_ I just found out that the title track of the original soundtrack is by Nick Cave.
