> In the last year, a mindset shift and approach appeared as a very simple idea: just do one thing, _that I want to do today_.

> The one thing can be small or big, easy or labored, fleeting or long. I carve out time to go play drums for two hours, go for a bouldering session, do a shorter 20 minute run, read a page of a book, eat something Iâ€™m really excited about, and more. Even on the most difficult day, I can adjust and find the smallest thing that I am excited about and do it.
