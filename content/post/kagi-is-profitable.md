Two years after its launch, Kagi, the pay-per-use search engine [is profitable](https://blog.kagi.com/what-is-next-for-kagi).

> We are also thrilled to report that we have achieved profitability. This significant milestone is a testament to our sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility. It demonstrates that our approach of offering a premium, ad-free search experience resonates with users who support a service aligning with their values. Becoming profitable allows us to reinvest in the business, further enhancing our offerings and ensuring that we can continue to provide a top-notch search experience.

This is a remarkable achievement. Two years ago, only a few would have bet on
its sustainability. I've tried Kagi's free tier with good results, but not as
much as I would like. It's not my default search engineâ€”not yet, at least. 

Over time, I've switched from free (as in "you, the user, are the product we
sell") to paid services. Years ago, I dropped Gmail and switched to Fastmail,
and I could never imagine going back. I'm good with paying for excellent
critical services. My data and I are not the product, and I'm invested in them
staying around long-term.
