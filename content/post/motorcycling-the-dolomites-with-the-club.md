Last weekend I went on a motorcycle trip with [my club][1]. Our goal was to
visit the beautiful Dolomites in the Italian Alps[^5]. We had twenty
motorcycles on the road, evenly split between modern classics (Bonnevillles in
all their variations) and adventure bikes (Tigers new and old). A great turnout
considering that the weather forecast for the weekend wasn't exactly great. Of
all the TOMCC members who registered, only two were missing because they tested
positive for COVID.

Seeing old and new friends and spending time together roaming the mountain
roads felt great. We even visited places I didn't know about, namely the [Soffia
Falls at Mis Lake][2] and [Castle Andraz][3]. After lunch at [Malga
Misurina][4], where the food was good and personnel not so much, we were
supposed to cover another long stretch of road up to the springs of the Piave
river. When we looked in that direction and saw the intimidating front of
blue/black clouds ready to open their floodgates on us, we changed our minds
and headed back to our base camp. We still got flooded, but certainly not as
much as if we'd pressed on with the original plan. The next day, a handful of
us continued roaming the countryside for more fantastic views, corners, food,
and camaraderie.

I'm grateful to Sandro ("Momo") for organizing this event. I know very well how
demanding and stressful running a motorcycle event can be. So far, we've always
been lucky to have people willing to take on the challenge and volunteer to
hold events all around the country. As long as this continues, we'll have
a bright future and lots of fun.
