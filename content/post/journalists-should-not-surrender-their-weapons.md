Kara Swisher, a dean in digital and classical journalism, has an interesting article in the New York Magazine.

Above all, she reasons why it is essential for journalists not to surrender their weapons and lawmakers to step in and finally harness an industry that always had free reign and no regulation, as it is considered inevitable.

Expert after expert I’ve talked to over the years has made the same point — in the new paradigm, engagement equals enragement.

What’s the opposite of the mommy state? Parent-free chaos.

I appreciate how Swisher was an initial proponent of digital advent, so much so that she [co-founded All Things Digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Digital). Yet, that didn't prevent her from foreseeing the troubled waters ahead.
