Today I released [Eve 2.2](https://pypi.org/project/Eve/2.2.0/). It is a maintenance release that drops old Pythons and adds support for the latest versions of the language. Long overdue, it also gets rid of some annoying deprecation warnings. As always, see the [changelog](https://docs.python-eve.org/en/stable/changelog.html#version-v2-2) for details. Many thanks to Bret Curtis and Guillaume Le Pape for their contributions to this release.
