On Sunday afternoon, I suddenly decided to take my motorcycle, ride to the foothills, leave the bike there, and hike the Monte Mauro loop, including the climb to the summit. 

The Monte Mauro loop is a classic route in the Vena del Gesso area. Wooded areas alternate with exposed stretches below the summit of Monte Mauro, where you literally walk on chalk outcrops. The trail is well marked, but you have to pay attention to the path because there are often alternatives (also marked) that can confuse you. It is an enjoyable short tour. 

I had no backpack or equipment, and I alternated between fast walking and running, especially in the final stretch, taking no rest. Therefore, the times reported (1h 56m) should be taken with a grain of salt. 

I had already been to Monte Mauro about thirty years ago, and I remembered it as being much less wooded, which was probably the case. Track and details on [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/it-it/tour/2576430037).
