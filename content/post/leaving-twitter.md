I'm abandoning Twitter/X. I'll freeze the account without deleting it; never say never, but I don't plan on coming back. I no longer feel comfortable on that platform and haven't been for a while. 

If you still want to follow me (I'd love for you to do so), the best option is [my website](https://nicolaiarocci.com)  where I always post first (RSS feed [here](https://nicolaiarocci.com/index.xml)), the [mailing list](https://buttondown.email/nicolaiarocci), or [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@nicola).
