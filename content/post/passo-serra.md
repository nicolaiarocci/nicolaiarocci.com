From Corezzo, a short hiking loop along the park's oldest mule tracks.

The Serra Pass mule track is one of the most fascinating in the entire Casentino territory, if only for the tangible memory of the millions of feet that have trodden, traveled, and worn it down over the centuries. It connected – and still connects – the upper Savio valley with that of Corsalone, branching off from the Romagna valley floor near the Gualchiere (about 2 km south of Bagno di Romagna) and climbing up the Nasseto ridge to reach the summit ridge at a pass that isn't exactly low (1,150 m), but evidently "convenient" for other reasons, given that its use is documented as early as prehistoric times and experienced an intense period with medieval pilgrimages directed to Rome and later to La Verna. 

This itinerary follows its best-preserved section, on the Tuscan side, from the mountain hamlet of Serra to the pass of the same name, among remnants of ancient stone paving where one seems to still perceive that "incessant wearing of steps" of pilgrims who descended from the Alps to reach the hospitals of Serra and Scapruggine, now safe from the dangers and storms of the ridge.

This trip was also an opportunity to take a ride on my motorcycle. The combination of motorcycling and hiking is not easy to pull off, especially with a classic bike like mine, but it's worth it as it combines two of my passions.
