I'm certainly a latecomer, but [NTS Radio](https://www.nts.live) is the bomb. I
have not opened Spotify (whose algorithm I find dull and repetitive) in the last
week, not even once. I go straight to NTS to find the best and most diverse
music from all genres, played by DJs and independent radio stations worldwide.
Absolute banger.
