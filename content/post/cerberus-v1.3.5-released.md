Thanks to [funkyfuture][1]'s tireless work, yesterday we released [version 1.3.5][2] of [Cerberus][3], the data
validation package for Python. This release officially supports Python 3.10 and 3.11, fixes a few issues, and proudly
displays a new documentation theme which I dig, and I hope you'll do the same. As usual, see the [changelog][4] for
details.
