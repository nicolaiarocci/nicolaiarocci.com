I was walking early this morning, [as usual](/early-morning-walks), when I came
across an unusual advertising sign. It was in Spanish, text only, red background and black
typography. I don't comprehend Spanish well enough to read it, so I photographed it
and sent it to Serena, who promptly replied with the translation.

Embarrassingly, just yesterday, I got a severe reprimand from Serena because I did not know or remember what day it was today. When I got back, I traced the [source][1] and found that the sign is actually available in several languages.
