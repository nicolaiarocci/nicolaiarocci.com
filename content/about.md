Hello there! My name is Nicola, and this is my website. I use it to store my
memories and thoughts, share exciting resources, and post technical content. I
follow the [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) methodology, meaning I share my
content on this website first and only later, eventually, on social media or
other platforms.

I'm a coder at heart author of several [open source projects][1], a [Microsoft
MVP][2], [conference speaker][4], teacher and consultant. I live in Ravenna,
Italy, where I lead the development of [Amica 20][5], a hybrid (cloud and
on-premise) accounting app for Italian small businesses. I also the creator and
organizer of [DevRomagna][26], the developer community in my area.

I am a former runner, climber and swimmer now keeping myself busy with
bodyweight training (I think it's called calisthenics these days). I love
reading [good books][8], hiking in the wilderness and riding my Triumph
Bonneville. My all time favourite quote: *"Only those who will risk going too
far can possibly find out how far one can go (T.S. Eliot)"*
